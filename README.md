Welcome to my first project in JavaScript Car-Details

The functionality of this app is for a user to look at different types of cars
It is meant to be user friendly, the user can click on any vehicle he/she wants
and find more information about that specific vehicle.
Can also add a comment to that specific vehcile.

It also has seeded data which comes from another repository.

Future functionality is to add likes to specific vehicles
